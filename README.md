# Client-Side-Scripting
Client Side Scripting Labs and Exam Projects
To run some of the projects you might need to get the live server extension in Visual Studio code and open the folder there.
These are a combination of Homeworks, Labs, Exams, and project I did for my Client Side Scripting class.
They are a mix of vanilla Javascript, Vue, and React.
