    <p>When it comes to dream cars from movies or even rides from TV series, we have tons of favorites to choose from. 
        Think K.I.T.T from Knight Rider, or General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard; or even that killer Nova from Death Proof.
        It gets difficult to choose dream cars from sci-fi movies mostly because of the hefty flights of fancy that come along with each car. 
        Sci-fi movies can show just about anything when it comes to vehicles. 
        Some vehicles can fly, turn into submarines, or even take you back to the future, pun intended. 
        When it comes to the imagination in the movies, the sky is the limit, or rather, space is. 
        So here are the 10 coolest rides from the sci-fi movies that made the mark, some which may have failed BO but turned into cult classics later on.
         We’ve seen these cars on screen, and yes, we’d love to take them for a spin.
